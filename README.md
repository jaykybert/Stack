# StackAndQueue
Generic implementations of different stacks and queues.

There are three different types of stacks/queues.
  - Static: A fixed-size stack/queue.
  - Dynamic: A variable-size stack/queue.
  - Circular: A stack/queue which returns to the beginning once it reaches the end.
  
 All of these types are implemented generically, and come with a demo to view their features.
